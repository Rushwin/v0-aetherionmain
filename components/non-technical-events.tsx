      fullDescription: `**Event Overview:** Participants engage in multiple rounds focused on distinguishing between noise and meaningful voice across various scenarios. Each round presents statements or audio clips requiring teams to swiftly identify noise versus voice elements. Points awarded for accurate identifications, with highest scoring team declared winner. Collaboration with external aids or non-team members strictly prohibited. Event host has final authority on scoring and disputes.

**Team Formation:** Game played in pairs (2 members per team) - one Speaker and one Listener.

**Game Setup:** The Listener wears headphones with loud music to block outside sound. The Speaker receives a set of words on paper slips. The Listener must guess words by lip-reading only.

**How to Play:** Speaker selects and says words clearly without shouting, gestures, or acting. Only lip movement allowed - no sign language, hand spelling, or pointing. Listener watches lips and says the word aloud to confirm. Teams continue with as many words as possible within the time limit.

**Time & Scoring:** Each team gets 2 minutes per round. 1 point awarded for every correctly guessed word. Highest score wins. Tie-breaker round played if needed.

**General Rules:** Speaker must not act, mime, or draw - only lip movement allowed. Listener cannot remove or lower headphone volume. Words must be spoken naturally and clearly. Organizers' decisions are final.

**Disqualification:** Using gestures, body language, or writing/drawing clues. Cheating by lowering headphone volume. Misbehavior or arguing with organizers.`,
